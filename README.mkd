LilyPond for Vim
================

This is a collection of scripts for working with LilyPond using Vim.

It's mostly copied from the LilyPond source code, except:

* Because it's in a separate repository, you can use it with
  [Pathogen][];

* The indent script uses [banner indentation][], which I prefer to the
  ugly K&R style used in the original.
